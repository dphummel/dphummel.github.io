# *Co-Intelligence*: Exploring Ethan Mollick's Vision of Human-AI Collaboration

### Introduction
We are in a time of change with AI.

Ethan shares thoughts on how AI can change our lives acting as a coworker, a teacher, a expert, and even a companion.  
AI works a a co-intelligence - it augments and can potentially replace human thinking improving productivity.
No one knows where this is heading

### Co-Intellgence Principles for working with AI

#### 1. Always invite AI to the table.
- Objective is to learn how AI's capabilities can benefit you (along with its weaknesses)
- AI is a General Purpose Technology - there is no instruction manual for how to use it.
- Innovation comes from trial and error - learn how to unlock its full potential.
- AI can be a thinking companion - help to address biases and improve our decision making.
- Ethan used AI to overcome the status quo bias by helping him understand his failure to write this book.

#### 2. Be the human in the loop.
- Incorporate human judgement and expertise in the use of AI
  - Example of accuracy: ChatGPT stated Ethan wrote a book which he did not write
  - LLMs are text prediction machines; they are good at guessing / correct answers however hallucinations are possible
- Need to check AI for accuracy
- Forsters responsiblity and accountability

#### 3. Treat AI like a person (but tell it what kind of person it is).
- Concern - anthropomorphizing AI
- Think of AI as a alien person (i.e., AI intern) vs. a human-built machine
- Define who the AI is and what problems you want to solve.
- Define the input to provide an LLM to make this happen - mission, etc.

#### 4. Assume this is the worst AI you will ever use.
- No reason to suspect that the abilities of the AI systems are going to stop growing soon.
- View AI limitations as transient and remain open to new developments
  - Help adatp to change
  - Remain competitive
 
### Scenarios
#### AI as a Creative
- Adding AI to Create Work
  - AI is already good work certain creative work - marketing, reviews, memos
  - Study by Shakked Noy and Whiteny Zhang from MIT (page 110)
  - Issue - pushing the button (page 119) vs. working internatively with AI
  - I believe the button should not be pushed
#### AI as a Tutor
- Provide personalized learning experiences - tailored to a student's needs
- Stundents can engage with content at home more effectively coming better prepared to cover hands-on activities at school.
- Share example of negotations

### Conclusion
- I am aligned with Ethan's guiding principles
  - Growth Mindset - “Those with a growth mindset see opportunities instead of obstacles, choosing to challenge themselves to learn more rather than sticking in their comfort zone. As Professor Dweck explains it: This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts.”
  - There is no instruction manual - opportunity to figure it out now
  - Share with others

***AI Disclosure:***  I used generative AI as an editor and proofreader this article.

-----------
- Concise Summary
- Author's Augment
- My appraisal and argument (focus on opinion not facts and details)
  - Details should support arguments
- Do I recommend the book

### Questions
 
- What is the thesis—or main argument—of the book?
- A.  Ethan thesis is we should be using AI (i.e., LLMs) as an intern/partner to help us learn and improve our intelligence.  AI can help us become better at the things we do today and this technology is only going to advance.  If you don't take this approach, you will be left in the dust.
  - If the author wanted you to get one idea from the book, what would it be?
    - A. Use the four guiding principles when using LLMs.  These principles will help you learn and safeguard you against harm.
  - How does it compare or contrast to the world you know?
    - A. As someone with the Growth Mindset, Ethan did not have to convince me to embrace AI.  I was aware of some of the risks of AI through my readings and hands-on experiences.  I did find value in some of the arguments he shared to justify the value AI can bring to a person including the 1) the negotition example, 2) the benefit colleagues gained from using AI vs. colleagues who did not use it.  These points helped me think about the possibilities.  
  - What has the book accomplished?
    - A. I think the book is more geared to helping convince a person with a Fixed Mindset to embrance AI.  It is hard to tell if the book achieves this point.  

- What exactly is the subject or topic of the book?
  - Does the author cover the subject adequately?
  - Does the author cover all aspects of the subject in a balanced fashion?
  - What is the approach to the subject (topical, analytical, chronological, descriptive)?

- How does the author support their argument?
  - What evidence do they use to prove their point?
  - Do you find that evidence convincing? Why or why not?
  - Does any of the author’s information (or conclusions) conflict with other books you’ve read, courses you’ve taken or just previous assumptions you had of the subject?

- How does the author structure their argument?
  - What are the parts that make up the whole?
  - Does the argument make sense? Does it persuade you? Why or why not?

- How has this book helped you understand the subject?
  - Would you recommend the book to your reader?
Beyond the internal workings of the book, you may also consider some information about the author and the circumstances of the text’s production:

- Who is the author?
  - Nationality, political persuasion, training, intellectual interests, personal history, and historical context may provide crucial details about how a work takes shape. Does it matter, for example, that the biographer was the subject’s best friend? What difference would it make if the author participated in the events they write about?

- What is the book’s genre?
   - Out of what field does it emerge? Does it conform to or depart from the conventions of its genre? These questions can provide a historical or literary standard on which to base your evaluations. If you are reviewing the first book ever written on the subject, it will be important for your readers to know. Keep in mind, though, that naming “firsts”—alongside naming “bests” and “onlys”—can be a risky business unless you’re absolutely certain.
