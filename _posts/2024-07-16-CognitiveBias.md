## Cognitive Bias

I was recently turned onto [Admired Leadreship Field Notes](https://admiredleadership.com/field-notes/) created by [CRA](https://crainc.com/).  Field Notes shares thoughts on challenges common to all leaders.  This led me to find [Confluence: The Intersection of AI and Communications](https://craai.substack.com/) by CRA.  CRA launched this [Substack](https://substack.com/home) "as a way to more broadly share the ideas, insights, and thinking at the intersection of AI and communication that capture our attention."  I have found Confluence, which just turned 1 year old in August, a very informative and particle communication on AI topics.  I highly suggest signing up for its articles on Substack.

The [7.7.24 Confluence article](https://craai.substack.com/p/confluence-for-7724) brought up the topic of *confirmation bias*.  

Confirmation bias, as defined by the [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/confirmation-bias), is "people's tendancy to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with their exsting beliefs."  People have a challenge analyzing information in an unbiased manner when they have developed an point of view on the topic.  People often relay on their instictive behaviors to process a lot of information coming at them, especially this day and age, to make decisions.  It is also thought configuration bias helps protect self-esteem by seeking information that supports thier existing beliefs.  

A couple of ways to overcome confirmation bias area:
- Consider all the facts, rather than just the facts which confirm your point of view
- Seek out different perspectives including those who have different views
- Be open to chaning your point of view in light of new facts
