## Using Generative AI to Combat Cognitive Biases

I was recently turned onto [Admired Leadreship Field Notes](https://admiredleadership.com/field-notes/) created by [CRA](https://crainc.com/).  Field Notes shares thoughts on challenges common to all leaders.  This led me to find [Confluence: The Intersection of AI and Communications](https://craai.substack.com/) by CRA.  CRA launched this [Substack](https://substack.com/home) "as a way to more broadly share the ideas, insights, and thinking at the intersection of AI and communication that capture our attention."  I have found Confluence, which just turned 1 year old in August, a very informative and particle communication on a variety of AI topics.  

The [7.7.24 Confluence article](https://craai.substack.com/p/confluence-for-7724) brought up the topic of *cognitive bias* within the contexto the Rashomon Effect.

[Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/confirmation-bias) defines cognitive bias as a "bias that results from the tendency to process and analyze information in such a way that it suppots one's preexisting ideas and convictions."  People have a challenge analyzing information in an unbiased manner when they have developed an point of view on the topic.  People often relay on their instictive behaviors to process the volume of information coming at them, especially this day and age, and make decisions which can lead to different interpretations of objective facts.  

There are over 250 known cognitive bias, including:
- ***Confirmation bias*** - the tendancy to seek only information that supports your perceptions and to devalue information which does not.  For example, failing to accept evidence that your solution does not solve all aspects of a problem.
- ***Anchoring bias*** - the tendancy to rely to heavily on one trait or piece of information when making a decision.  For example, proposing a solution based on a manager's preferences.
- ***Bandwagon effect*** - the tendancy to do or believe what others do or believe.  For example, taking a certain action because your mother always did it that way.

The term *Rashomon Effect*, as called out in the Confluence article, was derived from the classic 1950 Japanese film "Rashomon," directed by Akira Kursawa.  In the movie, a samuria is found murdered.  Each of the four charaters provide a unique account of the incident which significantly differ from each other.  This highlights the subjectivity with individual perspectives due to factors including congitive biases leading to challenges in determining the truth.  

To navigate this conundrum, it is important to understand a person's perspectives are shaped by congitive biases and to use techiques to overcome them.  A couple of these techniques are:
- Consider all the facts, rather than just the facts which confirm your point of view
- Seek out diverse perspectives including those who have different views.
- Be open to chaning your point of view in light of new facts.

Diverse perspectives is a very powerful concept and one which is being [emphasized](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/benefits-diverse-perspectives-workplace-diane-moura/) across many organizations today.  This concept refers to a range of different experiences and views which people bring to the table.  Bringing diverse perspectives to the table can help you a situation from different, new perspectives to help objective assess the facts and get to the truth.

Generative AI can help an person in seeking out diverse perspectives.  The Confluence team created a prompt using Claude 3.5 Sonnet to enable a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide a set of diverse perpsectices on a situation.  The prompt asks a LLM to help expose cognitive biases by providing an initial perspective on what happened along with 3-4 alternative or difffernt interpretations of the same situation.  Each narative will contain:
- Key assumptions and underlying beliefs
- Idenitfy data or facts emphasized or overlooked
- Explain how the perspective might influence decision making
- Share potential short-term and long-term consequences of acting on the perspective

The narative will also anlayize potential congitive biases, provide a set of probing questions for each narative to challenge core assuptions, and provide additional suggestions on additional data sources, and recommend startgies to mitigate congitive biases.

I tested out the Confluense Rashomon AI prompt using a situaiton which happened earlier in the week.  I woke up one morning to see many tree braches broken around our block.  A severe storm had come through Chicago the prior night.  I had initially concluded the branches had fallen due to the high winds from the storm, but I recognized this was my bias based on what I had seem in the past during similar storms.  

I entered the prompt into ChatGPT and shared the following situation "A branch from the tree located in my front yard had fallen to the ground last night.  A severe storm came through my town last night with very high winds and a lot of rain."

AI Disclosure:  I used generative AI as an editor and proofreader.
