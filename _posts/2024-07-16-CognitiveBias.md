## Using Generative AI to Combat Cognitive Biases

I was recently turned onto [Admired Leadreship Field Notes](https://admiredleadership.com/field-notes/) created by [CRA](https://crainc.com/).  Field Notes shares thoughts on challenges common to all leaders.  This led me to find [Confluence: The Intersection of AI and Communications](https://craai.substack.com/) by CRA.  CRA launched this [Substack](https://substack.com/home) "as a way to more broadly share the ideas, insights, and thinking at the intersection of AI and communication that capture our attention."  I have found Confluence, which just turned 1 year old in August, a very informative and particle communication on a variety of AI topics.  

The [7.7.24 Confluence article](https://craai.substack.com/p/confluence-for-7724) brought up the topic of *cognitive bias* within the contexto the Rashomon Effect.

[Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/confirmation-bias) defines cognitive bias as a "bias that results from the tendency to process and analyze information in such a way that it suppots one's preexisting ideas and convictions."  People have a challenge analyzing information in an unbiased manner when they have developed an point of view on the topic.  People often relay on their instictive behaviors to process the volume of information coming at them, especially this day and age, and make decisions which can lead to different interpretations of objective facts.  

There are over 250 known cognitive bias, including:
- ***Confirmation bias*** - the tendancy to seek only information that supports your perceptions and to devalue information which does not.  For example, failing to accept evidence that your solution does not solve all aspects of a problem.
- ***Anchoring bias*** - the tendancy to rely to heavily on one trait or piece of information when making a decision.  For example, proposing a solution based on a manager's preferences.
- ***Bandwagon effect*** - the tendancy to do or believe what others do or believe.  For example, taking a certain action because your mother always did it that way.

The term *Rashomon Effect*, as called out in the Confluence article, was derived from the classic 1950 Japanese film "Rashomon," directed by Akira Kursawa.  In the movie, a samuria is found murdered.  Each of the four charaters provide a unique account of the incident which significantly differ from each other.  This highlights the subjectivity with individual perspectives due to factors including congitive biases leading to challenges in determining the truth.  

To navigate this conundrum, it is important to understand a person's perspectives are shaped by congitive biases and to use techiques to overcome them.  A couple of these techniques are:
- Consider all the facts, rather than just the facts which confirm your point of view
- Seek out diverse perspectives including those who have different views.
- Be open to chaning your point of view in light of new facts.

Diverse perspectives is a very powerful concept and one which is being [emphasized](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/benefits-diverse-perspectives-workplace-diane-moura/) across many organizations today.  This concept refers to a range of different experiences and views which people bring to the table.  Bringing diverse perspectives to the table can help you a situation from different, new perspectives to help objective assess the facts and get to the truth.

Generative AI can help an person in seeking out diverse perspectives.  The Confluence team created a prompt using Claude 3.5 Sonnet to enable a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide a set of diverse perpsectices on a situation.  The prompt asks a LLM to help expose cognitive biases by providing an initial perspective on what happened along with 3-4 alternative or difffernt interpretations of the same situation.  Each narative will contain:
- Key assumptions and underlying beliefs
- Idenitfy data or facts emphasized or overlooked
- Explain how the perspective might influence decision making
- Share potential short-term and long-term consequences of acting on the perspective

The narative will also anlayize potential congitive biases, provide a set of probing questions for each narative to challenge core assuptions, and provide additional suggestions on additional data sources, and recommend startgies to mitigate congitive biases.

I tested out the Confluense Rashomon AI prompt using a situaiton which happened earlier in the week.  I woke up one morning to see many tree braches broken around our block.  A severe storm had come through Chicago the prior night.  I had initially concluded the branches had fallen due to the high winds from the storm, but I recognized this was my bias based on what I had seem in the past during similar storms.  

I entered the prompt into ChatGPT and shared the following situation "A branch from the tree located in my front yard had fallen to the ground last night.  A severe storm came through my town last night with very high winds and a lot of rain."

AI Disclosure:  I used generative AI as an editor and proofreader.

-----------------------------------------------
Here is the response I received from ChatGPT on the tree brach which fell in my front yard:

## Initial Perspective: ##

Last night, during a severe storm with high winds and heavy rain, a branch from the tree in your front yard fell to the ground. You believe the storm was the primary cause of the branch falling, given its intensity. This incident has likely raised concerns about the tree's overall stability and the potential for more damage if future storms occur. Your immediate thoughts might be focused on clearing the debris and possibly evaluating the tree to ensure it doesn't pose further risks.

**Narrative Analysis**

- **Key Assumptions and Underlying Beliefs:** The main assumption is that the storm was directly responsible for the branch falling. There's an underlying belief that the tree might be compromised due to the storm's impact.
- **Data or Facts Emphasized or Overlooked:** This perspective emphasizes the storm as the cause, potentially overlooking the tree's pre-existing condition or other contributing factors.
- **Influence on Decision-Making:** You might prioritize cleaning up the debris and considering whether the tree needs further assessment or removal to prevent future risks.
- **Potential Short-Term and Long-Term Consequences:** In the short term, you'll address the immediate safety concerns by clearing the fallen branch. Long-term consequences might include overlooking other underlying issues with the tree or missing signs that other branches or trees may also be at risk.

**Probing Questions:**

1. Was the tree healthy before the storm, or were there signs of weakness in the branches?
2. Could there be underlying factors, such as disease or root issues, that contributed to the branch falling?
3. What immediate steps should be taken to assess the tree's stability and prevent future incidents?
4. Should an expert, like an arborist, be consulted to evaluate the tree?
5. How can you prepare for potential future storms and their impact on your property?

## Alternative Narrative 1 ##

### The Tree Was Already Weakened ###

Before the storm, the tree was already weakened by factors such as age, disease, or previous damage. The storm simply exposed these vulnerabilities, causing the branch to fall. This perspective suggests that the tree might have been at risk for some time and that the storm highlighted an issue that would have surfaced eventually, even without such severe weather.

**Narrative Analysis**

- **Key Assumptions and Underlying Beliefs:** The assumption here is that the tree had pre-existing issues that made it susceptible to damage. There's a belief that the storm was just a catalyst, not the root cause.
- **Data or Facts Emphasized or Overlooked:** This narrative focuses on the tree's health before the storm, which might have been overlooked in the initial perspective. It might underemphasize the storm's severity.
- **Influence on Decision-Making:** You might decide to conduct a thorough examination of the tree and other trees on your property to identify and address any issues proactively.
- **Potential Short-Term and Long-Term Consequences:** In the short term, this could lead to more comprehensive assessments and potential tree removal. Long-term, it could result in a safer property environment and a more proactive approach to tree care.

**Probing Questions:**

1. Were there visible signs of damage or disease on the tree before the storm?
2. How often do you inspect the trees on your property for signs of weakness or disease?
3. Could the fallen branch indicate a larger problem with the tree's overall health?
4. Should you take preventive actions with other trees on your property?
5. How can you ensure that future risks are minimized through regular maintenance?

## Alternative Narrative 2 ##

### The Storm Was Unusually Severe ###

The storm was exceptionally severe, with winds and rain beyond what is typically experienced in your area. Even healthy trees were likely affected, and the fallen branch may be more a reflection of the storm's unusual intensity than the tree's health. This perspective suggests that the event was an outlier, and the tree might still be structurally sound despite the fallen branch.

**Narrative Analysis**

- **Key Assumptions and Underlying Beliefs:** The belief here is that the storm was so severe that even strong, healthy trees would struggle to withstand its impact. The assumption is that the fallen branch was an unfortunate but isolated incident.
- **Data or Facts Emphasized or Overlooked:** This view emphasizes the storm's intensity and possibly overlooks the tree's condition prior to the event. It may underplay the potential need for further tree assessment.
- **Influence on Decision-Making:** You might decide that the fallen branch was an isolated incident due to extreme weather and might not prioritize further action beyond cleanup.
- **Potential Short-Term and Long-Term Consequences:** In the short term, you may quickly clear the branch and resume normal activities. Long-term, this could lead to missing signs of potential future risks if the tree’s condition isn’t adequately assessed.

**Probing Questions:**

1. How does this storm compare to others you’ve experienced in terms of severity?
2. Were other trees or properties in your area similarly affected by the storm?
3. Is it possible that this branch falling was an isolated incident, or could it indicate more widespread issues?
4. What steps can be taken to protect your property from future severe weather events?
5. Should you invest in protective measures or infrastructure improvements for future storms?

## Alternative Narrative 3 ##

### The Branch's Position Made It Vulnerable ###

The specific position of the branch on the tree made it more vulnerable to falling during the storm. Perhaps it was a large or awkwardly angled branch, or it had grown in a way that made it more susceptible to wind and rain. This perspective suggests that the issue lies more with the specific branch and its placement than with the overall health of the tree or the storm's severity.

**Narrative Analysis**

- **Key Assumptions and Underlying Beliefs:** The assumption is that certain branches, due to their size or angle, are more likely to fall during a storm. This belief shifts focus from the overall health of the tree to the specific characteristics of the fallen branch.
- **Data or Facts Emphasized or Overlooked:** This narrative emphasizes the branch's position and physical attributes while possibly overlooking broader tree health or environmental factors.
- **Influence on Decision-Making:** You might focus on pruning or removing vulnerable branches in the future to prevent similar incidents, rather than removing the entire tree.
- **Potential Short-Term and Long-Term Consequences:** In the short term, you could address immediate safety concerns by removing other vulnerable branches. Long-term, this might reduce the risk of future incidents while preserving the tree.

**Probing Questions:**

1. What characteristics of the fallen branch made it more likely to fall during the storm?
2. Are there other branches on the tree with similar vulnerabilities?
3. Would pruning or reshaping the tree reduce the risk of future incidents?
4. Should a professional evaluate the tree to identify and address other potentially dangerous branches?
5. How can you maintain the tree’s overall health while managing the risk of falling branches?

## Bias Analysis: ##

- **Confirmation Bias:** Focusing solely on the storm as the cause of the branch falling may confirm your initial belief that external factors were responsible, potentially ignoring pre-existing conditions of the tree.
- **Availability Heuristic:** The recent, dramatic event of the storm is highly salient, which could lead to overestimating its role in the branch falling.
- **Anchoring Bias:** The assumption that the storm caused the fall might anchor your thinking, making it harder to consider other contributing factors.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** If you have invested time or money in maintaining the tree, you might downplay signs of deterioration or damage to avoid considering removal or costly treatments.

## Probing Questions: ##

1. What are other potential reasons for the branch falling beyond the storm?
2. How can you objectively assess the tree’s condition before and after the storm?
3. Could any of your assumptions be influencing how you interpret this event?
4. What additional information is needed to make a well-informed decision about the tree's future?

## Additional Sources ##

- **Arborist Consultation:** A professional arborist can provide an objective assessment of the tree's health and recommend appropriate actions.
- **Weather Analysis:** Reviewing detailed weather reports can help contextualize the storm's severity and its likely impact on trees.
- **Local Reports:** Gathering information from neighbors about their experiences with the storm can provide insight into how widespread the damage was and whether similar incidents occurred nearby.

## Bias Mitigation Strategies: ##

- **Seek Diverse Perspectives:** Consult with experts like arborists and landscapers to gain multiple viewpoints on the tree's condition and the branch's fall.
- **Devil’s Advocate Role:** Encourage someone to challenge your initial assumptions about the cause of the branch falling to explore alternative explanations.
- **Objective Assessment:** Use a systematic approach to evaluate the tree's health, such as regular inspections by a professional, to avoid reliance on anecdotal evidence or recent events.
- **Plan for Future Maintenance:** Establish a regular tree maintenance schedule to address potential risks proactively, reducing reliance on reactive decision-making after incidents occur.
