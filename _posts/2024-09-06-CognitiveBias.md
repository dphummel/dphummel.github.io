# Using Generative AI to Combat Cognitive Bias

I was recently discovered [Admired Leadreship Field Notes](https://admiredleadership.com/field-notes/) by [CRA](https://crainc.com/) which shares insights leadership challenges.  This led me to [Confluence: The Intersection of AI and Communications](https://craai.substack.com/), a [Substack](https://substack.com/home) by CRA that explores AI and communication.  Confluence, now a year old, provides practical information on various AI topics.  

The [July 7, 2024 Confluence article](https://craai.substack.com/p/confluence-for-7724) article introduced me to the Rashomon Effect and its link to cognitive biases.

### Cognitive Bias and the Rashomon Effect

Cognitive bias is our tendency to interpret information in a way that supports our existing beliefs.  This bias makes it hard to analyze information objectively, leading to different interpretations of the same facts. 

There are over 250 known cognitive biases.  Here are a few:
- ***Confirmation Bias*** - the tendancy to seek only information that supports your beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.  For example, failing to accept evidence that your solution does not solve all aspects of a problem.
- ***Anchoring Bias*** - the tendancy to rely to heavily on one trait or piece of information when making a decision.  For example, proposing a solution based on a manager's preferences.
- ***Bandwagon Effect*** - the tendancy to do or believe what others do or believe.  For example, taking a certain action because your mother always did it that way.

The *Rashomon Effect*, as highlighted in Confluence, comes from the 1950 Japanese film "Rashomon."  In the film, four charaters offer different accounts of the same event, illustrating how personal perspectives can distort the truth due to cognitive biases.

### Overcoming Cognitive Biases with Generative AI

To navigate this challenge, it's essential to recognize that our perspectives are shaped by cognitive biases and to use stratiges to overcome them:

- Consider all the facts, not just those that support your views.
- Seek diverse perspectives from people with different viewpoints.
- Stay open to changing your mind when new information arises.

Diverse perspectives are crucial in seeing situations from different angles and reaching more acureate conclusions.  Generative AI can help by provide these varied viewpoints.

The Confluense team developed a prompt using Claued 3.5 Sonnet, an AI model, to generate different perspectives on a situation.  This AI promot asks a Large Language Model (LLM) for:

- An initial perspective on the event.
- 3-4 alternative interpretations.
- Analysis of key assumptions, overlooked data, and potential decision-making influences.
- Possible cognitive biases, probing questions to challenge assumptions, additional data sources, and strategies to mitigate biases.

### My Experience with the Rashomon AI Prompt

I tested this prompt with a siutation from last week: A tree branch in my yard fell during a severe storm.  I initially assumed the storm caused the branch to fall, but I recognized this could be a bias based on past experiences.

When I entered the scenario into ChatGPT, it gave me an [initial perspective](https://github.com/dphummel.github.io/blob/main/_includes/RashomonExample2.md) that the storm was the cause but also suggested that I might be overlooking the tree's condition.  The alternative naratives included:

- The tree was already weakened, and the storm exposed its vulnerabilites. 
- The storm was unusually severe and even healthy trees struggle.
- The brach's position made it more vulnerable to falling.

These narratives helped me consider different factors and prompted me to take a closer looka t the tree's health, rather than just blaming the storm.

### Conclusion

Using Generative AI, like the Rashomon AI prompt, can quickly present diverse perspectives, helping us combat cognitive biases and make better decisions based on facts. 

I am excited to hear your experiences with the Rashomon AI prompt!
