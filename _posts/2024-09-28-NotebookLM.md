# NotebookLM: The Power of an AI Research Assistant
I was recently intrigued by [NotebookLM's](https://notebooklm.google/) capability to generate audio discussions from information including legal agreements, web pages, course reading, research notes, and sales documents.  What value could I receive from an audio discussion which I could not get from reading the information?  

Surprisingly, the audito discussions boiled down information to its basics in simple, easy-to-understand terms!  The discussion augmented the information source to help me take away the key insights quickly.

Please join me as I share my experiences and thoughts on this powerful feature.

### What is NotebookLM?
NotebookLM, an experimental offering from Google Labs, is a new type of notebook designed to help people learn faster. People are struggling today with the rapid growth of information, specifically how to synthesize facts and ideas from information sources. NotebookLM has set out address this challenge by speeding up the process of going from information to insights.

NotebookLM is powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro Language Model (LLM).  It becomes "grounded" in the information you upload by creating a personalized AI assistant that is versed in the information.  It can quickly summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and help you brainstorm new connections by answering questions about the information.

NotebookLM is able to generate the following content from the information sources:
- FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about the information
- Study Guide: Question and answer guide to help you validate your understanding of the information, essay questions, and a glossary of key terms
- Table of Contents: Organized structure of the information
- Timeline: A chronological sequence of events if applicable to the information
- Briefing Doc: Key themes and takeaways about the information
- Chat: Ability to interactively ask questions about the information and receive answers from the personalized AI
- Audio Discussion - A deep dive discussion on the information conducted by two English-speaking hosts

### Power of a Discussion
To better understand the capabilities of NotebookLM, I decided to test out the audio discussion feature on my blog posts.  My initial reaction was WOW! The conversation between the two hosts flowed like a natural, interactive, and engaging discussion. It was very hard to tell the discussion was AI-generated. 

The discussions added value beyond just reading each post by providing simpler explanations of concepts, highlighting key takeaways, and offering real-life applications of the ideas presented.  Examples include:
  - The hosts provided a simplier explanation of the 'type error' explained in the [Lessons Learned from Creating Code with Generative AI](https://dphummel.github.io/CreatingCode.html) post which made it a little easier for non-developers to understand.
  - With the [Co-Intelligence: Exploring Ethan Mollick's Vision of Human-AI Collaboration](https://dphummel.github.io/CoIntelligence.html) post, the hosts explained how to the Rashomon AI prompt can be used in real-life.  They suggeted: "the next time you are facing a decision and you are feeling the biases coming in, take a breadth and ask yourself what am I assuming here, am I seeing the whole picture or is my brain trying to pull a fast one on me?  If you are still feeling iffy, pull out the Rashomon AI prompt!"

### Limitations and Considerations
While NotebookLM's audio discussions are impressive, it's important to note some limitations:

- Accuracy: Google Labs advises that NotebookLM may sometimes give inaccurate responses, so it's wise to independently verify important facts.  There isn't a capability to correct predictions you identify in the audio.  For example:
  - With the [Co-Intelligence: Exploring Ethan Mollick's Vision of Human-AI Collaboration](https://dphummel.github.io/CoIntelligence.html) post, the hosts categorized the negotiation example as Hummel's example but it was actually Mollick's example from the book.
  
- Misinterpretations: There were instances where the AI slightly misinterpreted or misrepresented information from the original posts. For example:
  - In the [Lessons Learned from Creating Code with Generative AI](https://dphummel.github.io/CreatingCode.html) post, I emphasize the dataset used in the ChatGPT model contributed to the improved accuracy in the model.  The hosts stated ChatGPT was way better than Hummel's model because it used a complex neural network and a larger data set, which wasn't entirely accurate.

- Privacy: Google states your personal data is not used to train NotebookLM.  However, as with any AI tool processing your documents, it's crucial to consider privacy implications when uploading sensitive information.
 
### Conclusions
NotebookLM's audio discussion adds value beyond just reading an information source by highlighting the key insights and sharing examples to help you understand them (even with the limitations).  The product achieve this objective through a podcast like discussion which is engaging to listent to.  I also gained ideas on how improve the way I convery information in writing.

I encourage you to apply the AI-first mindset and test out NotebookLM audio discussion capability on your information sources.  I am personally curious to learn how it performs with multiple sources of information in a notebook.  You access a post discussion which I reference above by clicking on the "Listen to discussion about this post" link below the summary of each post on the home page.  Each discussion is about 8 to 9 minutes long.
